# v2.1-b
- Fixed multiplayer client side charge bugs with lua based (thanks outrightwings)
- Set for addons to attach custom blocks to the respawn obelisk block entity
- Disabled shulker shell core
    * CAREFUL: Any obelisk that previously had a shulker shell core inside of it will be corrupted. Break it to get your shell back and fix the issue.
