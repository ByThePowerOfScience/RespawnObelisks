# Welcome!

Respawn Obelisks is a small, simple, yet influential mod that revamps Minecraft's respawning system. Around the world, you will find new "respawn obelisks". You can set your spawn at these obelisks by simply clicking them. This replaces beds' respawning feature, so you can no longer respawn at beds (change this in the config). After dying, when you respawn at them, these obelisks will lose a set amount of charge. Keep the obelisk charged with ender pearls and eyes of ender(or, if you place a beacon under the obelisk, you can get infinite charge.) otherwise you will get cursed when attempting to respawn there. (The curse temporarily removes some of your max health.)

Obelisks only work in their respective dimensions(kaboom if in the wrong dimension, like beds). You can find overworld obelisks in villages and small structures that spawn in plains biomes.

Nether obelisks can be found in small blackstone shrines that spawn in the nether.

End obelisks can be found in wild end ships floating throughout the outer end islands.

Eventually, you may want to move these obelisks outside of their normal location. When breaking them, you will only get a "dormant obelisk", which does nothing on its own. Use JEI to see how to turn these dormant obelisks back into normal ones.

Respawn obelisks also need cores to be active. In wild obelisks, these cores are already present. You can use the cores from wild obelisks in your personal obelisks, but there is no way of crafting new cores.

You can upgrade the max charge of cores/obelisks in several ways. Check JEI to view them.
# Other Features
Respawn Obelisks has a ton of other features, many of which may go unnoticed. Below you can find small tutorials on how to use various features of this mod. I recommend you look through all of these, as some are very influential.
<details><summary>Core management</summary>
To place cores inside of an obelisk, simply right-click the obelisk with the core. To remove it, shift-click the obelisk with an empty hand.

<details><summary>Obelisk charging</summary>
To charge an obelisk, simply right-click it with a valid charging item. All charging items can be seen in JEI.

<details><summary>Comparator support</summary>
Obelisks actually have support for comparators! They will produce a redstone signal based on the amount of charge the obelisk has. Make sure the comparator is reading the bottom half of the obelisk.

<details><summary>Customizing obelisk</summary>
If you want to change the side of the obelisk you respawn at, simply hold shift and scroll your mouse wheel. (Make sure you do this on the bottom half of the obelisk)

P.S. There's a nifty little cosmetic feature done by doing something similar to this. I'll leave you to figure this out.
</details>

<details><summary>Teleportation</summary>
Using a recovery compass, you can teleport back to an obelisk by binding the compass to a lodestone under the obelisk.

<details><summary>Revival</summary>
Want to prevent your pet's demise? No problem! Obelisks can respawn entities bound to their cores. When a bound entity has died, a totem icon will appear above the obelisk. Use a totem of undying on the obelisk to respawn up to 3 dead entities.

If you are unable to bind an entity, it is likely because said entity can't be respawned. In the config, you can find a whitelist for all respawn-able entities. Most passive creatures should be supported by default.

<details><summary>Obelisk naming</summary>
Want your obelisk to stand out? Simply rename the core in an anvil to change the name displayed above the obelisk.

P.S. Want it to stand out even more? Shift+scroll on the top half of the obelisk. This will change the obelisk's "theme". Ko-fi supporters get access to more of these cool themes!
</details>

<details><summary>Soulbound/Obeliskbound enchantment</summary>
Wish to keep items after death? Look no further! When respawning at an obelisk, items with the "obeliskbound" enchantment will be restored!

By default, there are 3 levels. Each level gives a 25% chance to keep the item. This is configurable.
You cannot trade with villagers to get the enchantment, nor can it be found in an enchantment table. Change this in the config.

</details>

<details><summary>Immortality Curse</summary>
When respawning at an obelisk with no charge, you will be cursed. Each level of this curse removes 1 heart, up to 5 times. After the 5th time, you will be sent to world spawn.

# Config:
Respawn obelisks is INSANELY configurable. And when I say it, I mean it. There are tons of features disabled by default(largely for balancing reasons) in the config. Is the mod too underpowered? Check the config! You could decrease the cost of respawning, remove the immortality curse, add new cheaper charge items, and so much more.

Don't want people to use up your obelisk's charge? Check out the player trust system(enabled by default)! Or, even better, enable per-player charge!
